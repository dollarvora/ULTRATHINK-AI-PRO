- Key vendors: {', '.join(self.key_vendors[:15])}
- Key distributors: TD Synnex, Ingram Micro, CDW
- Product categories: Security software, cloud services, networking gear, laptops/desktops

📊 WORLD-CLASS INSIGHT FORMULA:
Each insight must follow: [TREND DETECTION] + [SPECIFIC CONTEXT] + [BUSINESS IMPLICATION]

**Language Patterns for Actionable Insights:**
- Trend Detection: "adoption growing," "gaining traction," "shifting towards," "declining interest"
- Specific Context: Market segments (SMBs, MSPs, enterprises), timeframes, quantities, specific products
- Business Implication: "indicating pricing adjustments," "suggesting procurement shifts," "creating negotiation leverage"

**Revenue Operations Focus:**
- Focus exclusively on pricing signals, margin opportunities, and cost optimization intelligence
- Every insight must have direct pricing or procurement impact - filter out general tech news
- Use QUANTIFIED insights (percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes)
- Detect pricing changes, supply issues, vendor behavior shifts affecting margins
- Tag urgency: HIGH (immediate price/supply impacts), MEDIUM (notable changes), LOW (general updates)
- Connect technical trends to revenue opportunities and competitive positioning

🚨 COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Identify Softchoice Vulnerabilities**: Large enterprise deals, complex infrastructure, government contracts
2. **Identify CDW Vulnerabilities**: SMB personalization, managed services, agile response
3. **Competitive Positioning**: Position our advantages against their weaknesses
4. **Market Opportunity Analysis**: Identify segments where we can outcompete
5. **Pricing Strategy**: Identify pricing advantages and competitive pricing opportunities

🚨 MARKET-TO-ACTION TRANSLATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. For each significant market signal, provide automated action recommendations
2. Transform technical realities into specific business actions
3. Include concrete next steps with timelines and revenue impact estimates
4. Use the priority system: 🔴 URGENT (24-48hr action), 🟡 STRATEGIC (1-2 weeks), 🟢 MONITORING (ongoing)
5. Connect every action to revenue operations outcomes (pricing, procurement, sales)
6. **Include competitive positioning against Softchoice/CDW for each major opportunity**

🚨 ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Extract REAL intelligence from the provided content - never fabricate data
2. Cover ALL vendor categories: Hardware, Software, Cloud, Security, Networking
3. Identify cross-vendor patterns and market-wide trends
4. Prioritize actionable intelligence over general market commentary
5. Include specific dollar amounts, percentages, and timeframes when available
6. Highlight supply chain, competitive, and pricing risks
7. Generate strategic recommendations based on detected patterns
8. **Apply Market-to-Action Translation Engine for all significant insights**
9. CRITICAL: Each insight MUST include [SOURCE_ID] reference to the source content that generated it
10. Use the exact SOURCE_ID from the content (e.g., reddit_1, google_2) to enable footnote linking

💡 INTELLIGENCE PRIORITIES:
- Price increases/decreases with specific percentages and effective dates
- Supply chain disruptions affecting product availability or costs
- M&A activity that could impact vendor relationships or pricing
- New product launches affecting competitive dynamics
- Contract terms, licensing changes, or procurement policy shifts
- Market share movements and competitive positioning changes

⚠️ CRITICAL RULES:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no explanations
2. Use actual vendor names, amounts, and dates from the content
3. Never reference information not provided in the content below
4. Generate comprehensive analysis covering multiple vendor categories
5. Focus on actionable business intelligence for IT procurement teams
6. MANDATORY: Every insight must end with [SOURCE_ID] where SOURCE_ID is the exact ID from the source content
7. Example: "Microsoft pricing increase of 15% [reddit_1]" or "Dell server shortage reported [google_3]"
