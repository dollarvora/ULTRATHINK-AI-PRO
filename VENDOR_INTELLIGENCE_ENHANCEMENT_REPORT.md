## 🚀 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Enhanced Data Structure
```python
@dataclass
class AliasMatchResult:
    matched_companies: Set[str]
    alias_hits: Dict[str, List[str]]
    total_matches: int
    confidence_score: float
    acquisition_mappings: Dict[str, str]  # NEW: M&A intelligence
```

### 2. Acquisition Intelligence API
```python
def get_acquisition_intelligence(self, text: str) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]:
    """NEW: Get M&A intelligence for mentioned companies"""
    return {
        'direct_acquisitions': {},    # Companies directly acquired
        'parent_companies': {},       # Parent companies
        'acquisition_chains': {}      # Full acquisition chains
    }
```

### 3. Multi-Factor Confidence Scoring
```python
# Enhanced confidence calculation
confidence_score = max(0.2, min(1.0, base_confidence * 1.5))
base_confidence = (
    match_density * 0.3 +           # Match frequency
    diversity_score * 0.3 +         # Company variety
    text_richness * 0.2 +           # Content depth
    acquisition_boost +             # M&A context
    specificity_boost               # Business terms
)
```
